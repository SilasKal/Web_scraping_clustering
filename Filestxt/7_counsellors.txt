Lazarus Fitopoulos, PhD, Psychologist
L'Ordre des Psychologues du Quebec (OPQ)
 BA Psychology, MA, PhD Counselling Psychology, McGill University
 Counselling since 2000
"My integrative approach is most informed by these 5 core therapy values:

Promoting a collaborative and egalitarian therapy relationship;
Trusting and valuing client perspectives and resources;
Consistent attention to potential solutions and recognition of strengths;
The development of realistic expectations encouraging gradual progress toward self-initiated change; and
Increasing ease of putting words to emotional experience."








Marc Leger, MEd, Psychologist
L'Ordre des Psychologues du Quebec (OPQ)
 BA Psychology, Concordia University; MEd Counselling Psychology, McGill University
 Counselling since 1996
"My main goal as a counsellor is to assist you to be your own therapist. I believe that change comes through a greater awareness and so I work to help you understand the emotional truth behind any symptom or issue you might be dealing with. In this way, you can begin to choose how better to respond as opposed to just react. My approach tends to be experiential in nature and body-centered. This means becoming mindful of not only what you are thinking, but also what you are feeling. I ascribe to the Buddhist saying 'Complete acceptance and profound change are the same.' Though this might be challenging at times, I believe embodying this principle is what leads to true growth."







Anna Lenkovskaya, MA, Psychologist
Ordre des Psychologues du Quebec (OPQ)
 BA Psychology, MA Counselling Psychology, McGill University
 Counselling since 2001
"My approach to therapy is a combination of client-centred and cognitive-behavioural interventions. I favour this eclectic approach because it seeks to adapt therapy to the particular needs of a specific client. My philosophy of therapy is to help clients define specific goals, assist them in challenging their thoughts and reaching their own conclusions, and being actively involved in learning skills needed to cope with their problems and build self-efficacy and a sense of mastery."







Jamie Mayerovitch, MA, Psychologist
Ordre des Psychologues du Quebec (OPQ)
 BA Psychology, MSc Psychiatry, MA Counselling Psychology, McGill University
 Counselling since 2002


"When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves."
Victor Frankl
"Changing the way we think, feel, or act can be a difficult and often daunting task. (If it wasn’t, you probably wouldn’t be perusing this page right now.) My goal as a counsellor is to help facilitate constructive change. To accomplish this, I work collaboratively with you, using a variety of different techniques that are tailored to your personality and the issues that you present. I try to create an environment where you will feel listened to, understood, supported and empowered. I look forward to working with you."







Jewel Perlin, PhD, Psychologist
Ordre des psychologues du Québec (OPQ); Ordre des travailleurs sociaux et des thérapeutes conjugaux et familiaux du Québec (PSW) 
 BA Psychology, BSW, MSW, PhD Counselling Psychology, McGill University
 Counselling since 2000
"As a licensed psychologist, I have extensive experience in psychotherapy and counselling. My style is collaborative, empathic, nurturing and non-judgmental. I believe each one of us is resilient and possesses the ability to develop a sense of agency. Using an integrative approach, I specialize in helping clients to gain deeper personal insight and understanding, examine and improve their strengths and competencies, and empower positive and constructive changes they seek in their lives. I make special efforts to tailor my approach to the individual in the room, in order to maximize the potential that clients will be engaged and active participants in their therapy."







Sonia Papakonstantinou, MEd, Psychologist
L’Ordre des Psychologues du Quebec (OPQ)
 BA Psychology, Concordia University; MEd Counselling Psychology, McGill University
"My hope is to create a safe space that will encourage you to explore and ultimately assign adaptive meaning to life events. The approaches I incorporate in my practice include elements of cognitive behavioural therapy, systems theory and dialectical behavioural therapy. My goal is to encourage greater self-awareness that will allow you to have realistic goals, make positive choices and feel equipped to navigate life’s challenges. I believe it is important to recognize and accept what we can and cannot control and understand that healing and/or resolution is possible regardless."







Irene Petsopoulis, MEd, Psychologist
Order of Psychologists of Quebec (O.P.Q.)
 BA Psychology, MEd Counselling Psychology, McGill University
 Counselling since 1999
"Therapeutically, I believe in offering students a supportive environment in which they can freely explore thoughts, feelings and identify changes that they want to achieve. For me, change is reflected in daily shifts and is something that occurs outside of the session. As such, I work to empower my students to take their new learnings and put them into practice."







Ronda Rowat, MA, Psychologist
L'Ordre des Psychologues du Quebec (OPQ)
 BA Honours Psychology, Concordia University; MA Counselling Psychology, McGill University
 Counselling since 2004
"I believe that psychological growth and emotional well-being are fostered by a better understanding of how our thoughts affect our feelings about ourselves and how those feelings are manifested in our interactions with the world. I work in partnership with clients to create meaningful change in their lives through interventions derived from interpersonal, narrative, cognitive-behavioural and existential approaches."







Eric Widdicombe, MEd, Psychologist
L’Ordre des Psychologues du Quebec (OPQ)
 BFA, BA Concordia University; MEd Counselling Psychology, McGill University
 Counselling since 1999
"I believe that psychotherapy is more art than science. In the safe containment of therapy, clients are able to engage their imagination and explore possibilities and to make informed choices and accept the responsibility of those choices. To struggle is to be human and I am curious to understand the function of depression, anxiety and addictions in my client’s lives. As a licensed psychologist, I have been practising for the last 17 years in a number of different environments: academic, psychiatric and at a residential rehabilitation centre. I use a holistic and collaborative approach to meet the needs of my clients. I have an ability to actively and deeply listen and to provide clients with a sense of validation and endeavour to help clients make meaningful connections with others and themselves and to set realistic and attainable goals.
"Given my background in couples and family therapy graduating from the Argyle Institute of Human Relations in 2006, I am comfortable using a systems lens to help put the individual in context. From 2010 until the present I have been a service provider for Kahnawake Shakotiia’takenhas Community services and have provided evaluations, assessments and psychotherapy for individuals, couples and families. I have a particular interest in engaging men in the process of psychotherapy."
