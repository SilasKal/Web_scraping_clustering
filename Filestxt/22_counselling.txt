Our services
Learn more about how Counselling and Psychological Services and the Zen Dens have continued to support students remotely since March 2020.
Consult our 2020/2021 report >
Counselling and Psychological Services offers short-term counselling to registered Concordia students who are in Quebec. Our services can help patients find new approaches to managing persistent mental health concerns and challenging life situations.
Counselling plans — including the number of sessions and their frequency — vary according to each client’s needs. Many students make significant progress within three to five sessions.
Some services go beyond the scope of our practice as a short-term counselling centre. If you require long-term care or specialized services, we will refer you to the appropriate care or service provider.
We offer both virtual and in-person appointments. Please note that under Ordre des Psychologues du Québec (OPQ) guidelines, appointments are only available to students residing in Quebec.
For holistic and timely support, students are encouraged to use all services at their disposal to access the mental health services they need as quickly as possible. This includes accessing off-campus services and tele-counselling lines that are covered by student association insurance policies, as well as private policies you may be covered under.
For more resources, consult our mental health service list. 









Workshops & eventsVisit the Zen Dens for wellness workshops and events available to all students.







Access services
If you or someone you know is experiencing a crisis, please consult our list of emergency resources that can provide immediate support.


Connect with 24/7, multi-lingual counselling services provided by mental health professionals


Tele-counselling services in our wider network of providers are free and available 24/7. These services can offer short-term counselling by phone or video. Tele-counselling is a great first step in addressing your mental health needs.


Mental health services in the community


Concordia’s health insurance plans offer mental health coverage for mental health services. 
Please review your plan for more details.







Triage appointments at Counselling and Psychological Services
If you are new to Counselling at Concordia, we will begin by assessing your needs at a triage appointment.
We offer a limited number of triage appointments each week, and there may be a wait time between your initial triage appointment and your first meeting with a counsellor. To prioritize your mental health, we strongly recommend consulting with the 24/7 tele-counselling services listed above.
Please note that if you already have access to a mental health practitioner outside Concordia, your needs will be best met by continuing to see them for ongoing care.






 
                    Request a triage appointment
                








Booking opens every Friday at 9 a.m. on a first-come, first-served basis. To request a triage appointment, send an email to CPS.info@concordia.ca.
Please note that this email is not for emergencies; in case of emergency dial 9-1-1 or consult our resources for urgent care. 
All triage appointments are conducted virtually through Virtual Care @ Concordia; a secure platform that meets Quebec's regulations on information security for health information.












Students currently registered with Counselling and Psychological Services
If you are currently being followed by a counsellor at Concordia or were within the last year, please email your counsellor directly for an appointment.
Cancellation policy
You must cancel 24 hours in advance if you are unable to keep your appointment with us. Email your counsellor to cancel your appointment.
