 Tel: 514-848-2424 ext. 4697
 Location: EV 2.743

Through the Office of the Associate Dean, Faculty Relations and Inclusion, the Faculty of Fine Arts liaises with Department Chairs, Academic Unit Heads and faculty members to ensure conformity with, and adherence to, and implementation of collective agreements. These responsibilities include: organizing faculty orientations, information sessions, workshops and training to best support and inform academic personnel; advising, developing, and optimizing policy with respect to faculty workload; advising the Dean on all CUFA, CUPFA and TRAC affairs.
With a focus on Equity and Diversity Strategic Planning and implementation, the associate dean plays a key role in translating University goals into actionable practice at the Faculty-level, in consultation with the dean. They also work closely with the dean, associate deans, director of administration, academic personnel administrator, and other dean’s office staff to ensure collegial and effective administration and long-term sustainability and success of the Faculty of Fine Arts.






 
                    About the Associate Dean
                








Kristina Huneault is a Professor of Art History, a former Concordia University Research Chair, and a founder of the Canadian Women Artists History Initiative. She has an MA in Canadian art history from Concordia (1994) and a PhD in British visual culture from the University of Manchester (1998), where she was a Commonwealth scholar. She has taught at Concordia since 1999, and was the University's emerging research fellow in 2004. Professor Huneault's approach to art combines detailed historical research with theoretical questioning and close looking. She is the author of I’m Not Myself at All: Women, art and subjectivity in Canada (MQUP) and Difficult Subjects: Working Women and Visual Culture, Britain 1880-1914 (Ashgate), the co-editor of Rethinking Professionalism: Women and Art in Canada (MQUP), and the author of numerous book chapters and journal articles on art, gender, and colonialism. As mother to a teenaged son, she is particularly aware of the breadth and the intensity of the workload that many women navigate, often unequally and without recognition.
