Graduate application deadlines




Deadline dates are subject to change without prior notice. The deadline to submit your application varies by program. Some programs also require you to submit other documents too, at the same time (for example, a portfolio or a writing sample). 
International students: Considering the waiting period involved in meeting the entry requirements to Canada and Quebec, we strongly encourage international applicants to apply early and submit supporting documents prior to the deadline.
Late applications: Priority will be given to applications submitted on time. In some cases, programs may continue to accept applications as long as there is space available.
