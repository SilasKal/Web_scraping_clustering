COTUTELLEGive your PhD a global perspective











Did you know you can pursue doctoral research at more than one university? A cotutelle opens doors to international researchers and gives you a joint PhD.
 



A cotutelle refers to an agreement on joint supervision between two universities at the doctoral level. It allows the students to get a joint PhD degree delivered and recognized by both institutions.
Full-time doctoral students can take advantage of an exceptional opportunity to earn a joint PhD degree while developing strong connections with international partners. Through the cotutelle program, PhD candidates work in collaboration with distinguished faculty members from Concordia and an international partner university to produce an original thesis.
The program requires that students satisfy each institution's minimum requirements and submit their dissertation to both universities prior to graduation. Successful candidates receive a PhD degree from Concordia and the partner institution.








Benefits of a cotutelle




For the student

Opportunities for international research
Collaborations with other researchers
A recognized joint degree from Concordia and the partner university 





For the university

Expansion of international relationships for Concordia
Raises Concordia’s visibility abroad as a centre of cutting-edge research
Provides supervisors and faculty members with opportunities to develop international collaborations









Candidate FAQs






 
                    Where can I do a cotutelle?
                








You are eligible to register at any international accredited university that is open to a cotutelle agreement. Concordia supervisors must approve the partner university and agree to work in collaboration with the chosen co-supervisor.











 
                    How can I apply as a Concordia student?
                









Discuss the cotutelle plan with your current Concordia supervisor
Contact Irene Grigoropoulos, graduate admission advisor at the School of Graduate Studies, to discuss a potential cotutelle before communicating with the partner university
If approved, reach out to your potential co-supervisor at the partner university
Follow the requirements needed to enrol at the partner university
Complete a Cotutelle Agreement form with your supervisor, in collaboration with Irene Grigoropoulos

All other required signatures will be collected by the School of Graduate Studies
Once both universities approve the cotutelle program, you will be admitted












 
                    Do I have to submit an admission application to the partner university?
                








Yes, you must follow the partner university’s application/admission procedures.












 
                    Do I have to pay tuition fees?
                








You will pay tuition for the terms you are registered at Concordia University (a minimum of 3 non-consecutive terms are required). You need to contact the partner university for questions about their tuition fees.











 
                    Do I have to start the cotutelle in the first term of my PhD?
                








No. However, the cotutelle arrangement should be established as early as possible.












 
                    Am I still eligible to receive funding if I hold a Federal or Provincial Granting Agency award?
                








Yes, in most cases. It is best to contact the Graduate Awards Office to ensure that your particular award is eligible.











 
                    Do I still receive my Concordia University internal scholarship when registered at the partner institution?
                








Internal funding administered through the School of Graduate Studies will be honored when abroad. Students must seek approval for any internal awards administered through their department or Faculty while away on a cotutelle.
