Ground Provisions
            






Dramaturgical Ecologies (DE), a Concordia-based multi-disciplinary group of artists and researchers interested in the ecologies of dramaturgical processes, invites you to attend the three online sessions of their Ground Provisions event at the 3ecologies (Sainte-Anne-du Lac, QC), closing a year-long series of outreach activities focused on articulating how the concepts of &lsquo;blackness&rsquo; and &lsquo;dramaturgy&rsquo; productively rub up against one another.<br/><br/>Using a necessarily interdisciplinary lens, our explorations will move across and through Black studies; diaspora studies; visual arts, dance and performance practice; process philosophy; and performance studies gathering artists, scholars and public intellectuals, aiming to both generate and destabilize dialogue and reflection on black performance and dance dramaturgy. <br/><br/>In dialogue with Dr. Erin Manning, who brings the philosophy of movement into the realms of neurodiversity and blackness to inquire into the normative prescriptions of whiteness; and Dr. Adebayo Akomolafe&rsquo;s provocative reflections on post-activism, global crisis and ontofugitivity, Ground Provisions emerge from a desire to generate dialogue and reflection on dance dramaturgy and black performance studies, diasporic conceptualizations of blackness in its creative manifestations.<br/><br/>ACTIVITIES:<br/><br/>THU, DEC 15th, 2-5pm:<br/>Facilitated reading of a text (to be sent in advance upon registration) that grounds a conversation on how blackness and dramaturgy productively rub up against one another. With the participation of the Dramaturgical Ecologies group, scholars and practitioners&rsquo; discussants of the ABCs of DE, Dr. Bayo Akomolafe and Dr. Erin Manning.<br/><br/>FRI, DEC 16th, 2-5pm:<br/>Dr. Erin Manning and Dr. Bayo Akomolafe will be catalysts to themes that are pillars to Dramaturgical Ecologies - blackness and dramaturgy -, from within the fields that are dear to them: subjectivity, transversality, neurodiversity, perception, process philosophy, ontofugitivity, post-activism and black studies.<br/><br/>THIS EVENT IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND FREE<br/><br/>A Zoom link will be provided for the two online sessions (the 15th and 16th) upon registration
