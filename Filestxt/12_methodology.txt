METHODOLOGYHow we built the new strategic plan








Our strategic planning process combined approaches that are consultative and representative, and resulted in a one-page graphic representation of our strategic plan.Though Fall 2021 and Winter 2022, we held broad consultations, involving a combination of events: a survey, workshops, townhalls, group and individual discussions. Field analysis was conducted and university-wide strategic directions were consulted. It was also a recurring item on our Faculty Council agenda.Strategic planning committeeA representative committee was tasked with interpreting consultation results, collectively setting strategic goals, and drafting the plan. This representative committee included: the Dean, an undergraduate and graduate student, four faculty members, two staff members and an external moderator. The committee members came together in April to bring forward the ‘pulse’ of the community and collectively craft a document grounded in the results of the consultations. DesignWe took a pillars approach to building the plan, in which we identified 5 focused strategic imperatives, that are broad yet pointed, and can be used to direct choices and actions for the greatest, strategic benefit of the community. These are complemented by our mission, vision, and values. This approach provides potential for action and change but requires effective communication so that members of the community feel included.  Action planningFollowing release of the strategic plan in Fall 2022, the faculty units (academic departments, CDA, CTCs, VCR, FoFA Gallery, research units, etc.) are invited to interpret the plan to create their own action plans that address nuance and local specificity. An action planning template will be presented in a series of workshops to help guide this exercise.  Let’s keep it simple! As important as it is, the strategic planning exercise should not call upon our community in a way that interferes with teaching, learning and research. It is intended to be a framework to help us plan for our future, seize opportunities, and navigate change together.
