Concordia pays tribute to the life of Sara Weinberg
Education department mourns the loss of a beloved senior lecturer

Faculty, staff, and students in the department of Education are deeply saddened to learn of the death of Sara Weinberg, director of the Early Childhood and Elementary Education program and senior lecturer in the department. Sara passed away peacefully on June 27, 2018, surrounded by her family.
Sara was a passionate and dedicated teacher throughout her life.  She started her career as a teacher of children, and, since 1984, began instructing undergraduate students preparing to teach children. As an instructor and as the director of the Early Childhood and Elementary Education Program and director of internships, she supported students in countless ways. She was often the very first faculty member students met through Concordia's annual Open Houses and admissions interviews. As students progressed through the program, Sara played a central role not only in teaching them in the classroom, but also in supervising their internships.
She was known to brave Montreal blizzards, rainstorms, and road construction to mentor students in the field, and arrive still smiling. She had a keen sensitivity to students' needs and students greatly appreciated her experience, knowledge, kindness, and willingness to help them succeed in their studies and as novice teachers. Her dedication and skill was formally recognized in 2007, when she received the first Dean's award for excellence for being a "committed, engaging, clear, innovative, energizing and accessible" teacher.
As the liaison between Concordia University and school principals and cooperating teachers, Sara was tireless. But her commitment to students and to education did not stop there.  Sara served on numerous committees over the years within the department of Education, including the department's steering and hiring committees.  She was also active in the educational community. She served, for example, as a member of the MELS' Kindergarten Provincial Committee and the Organization Mondiale pour l'Éducation Préscolaire, and participated in the Leadership Committee for English Education in Quebec. Most recently, in 2018, she contributed to assuring that the Early Childhood and Elementary Education program's accreditation at the provincial level was renewed.

Sara was also a valued colleague, appreciated for her easygoing nature and graciousness.  Her colleagues describe her as "professional", "caring", "warm", "fair", "generous", and "beloved". Colleagues also evoked fond memories of Sara's sense of humour, evident in the rhymes she often penned for colleagues as they reached milestone events.
Within the Montreal community, Sara served on the Board of Directors of the organization Canadian Jewish Holocaust Survivors and Descendants, reflecting her roots as the daughter of holocaust survivors and her devotion to holocaust remembrance, commemoration and education over many years.
In keeping with this devotion, Sara's family has announced the “Sara Weinberg Memorial Fund for March of the Living”. Contributions to the fund can be made c/o Federation CJA, (514) 734-1644, or by email.
A memorial fund to support teacher education is also being established at Concordia University has also been established.
